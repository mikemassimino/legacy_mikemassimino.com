- quote : “Mike Massimino writes about space with an astronaut's eye and an engineers precision. You'll be impressed with his journey and his perspective on where a well-developed space program can take us in the future.”
  author : Senator John Glenn
- quote : “Every generation of astronauts needs a storyteller - a person with wit, humor, and passion who has lived out collective dreams of space exploration and returned to tell us all about it. Mike Massimino is that person. He's that astronaut. And this is his story.”
  author : Neil deGrasse Tyson
- quote : “Inspired by moonwalkers, Mike grew up, became an astronaut, and fixed the Hubble Space Telescope, all while remaining some kinda’ humble. You can’t help but follow him from Long Island to the bottom of the spacewalk practice pool, then 350 miles up and back. He’s a spaceman through and through; he tells how hard work can take you out of this world.”
  author : Bill Nye the Science Guy, CEO The Planetary Society
- quote : “During astronaut training, Massimino was merely adequate at most tasks, never the best. But after returning to Earth, he began lecturing on his experiences, and he decided, “Maybe I could be one of the best at telling the story of space.” If “Spaceman” is any indication, he might well be.”
