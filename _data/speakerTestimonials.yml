      “The session went really well! We had almost 300 people from around the world tune in live for Mike's presentation.
      He told a great story and wove in messages around not giving up on your dreams, teamwork, working in isolation, and
      a lot of others. We have received extremely good feedback from participants, unsolicited, around his story and message.
      I think it was a home run or a perfect lift off!“

    “He was really great to work with and just some amazing stories and we’re bummed our clients couldn’t meet
    him in person, but we think this is the next best thing. Sort of like him talking to us from space.
    Many of his stories are very topical to what we are all going through right now including the quarantine
    astronauts go through before going into space and the isolation even in space being disconnected from the world.
    The story of teamwork with his fellow astronaut classmates was especially powerful for me—this idea that we win
    or lose together. A great reminder that we’re all in this together right now. And I enjoyed his story about
    needing to both accept change and anticipate change in the same moment. You have 30 seconds of venting,
    ranting, or feeling sorry for yourself—and then you move forward. Because the only constant is change.
    Really powerful! Please thank him for us.”

    “OMG – he was awesome!  Everyone loved him!! He stayed to sign books and I think all 300 people waited in line to
    have him do so. We extended lunch by 30 minutes so that everyone could have a chance to meet him, get their photos
    with him, and get their books signed. Mike is so genuine and so personable.  He mingled with everyone before and
    after his talk. He is truly fabulous.  We’ll certainly recommend him to other groups within UnitedHealth Group.
    We couldn’t have had a better motivator for our team.”

    “I had the pleasure of hiring Mike to be our closing guest speaker at our annual user summit in Houston.
    In my role over the years, I have hired countless speakers to close out large user events and I will say that
    Mike is one of the best that I have ever hired. Not only is he a down to earth person and easy to talk with,
    but the message he delivers relates to everyone. Normally when you hire an external speaker to close out an event,
    there is usually a good size drop-off of people who are trying to catch a flight out of town. Not in our case.
    I looked around the room when Mike started and it was close to being as crowded as day 1 of the event
    (roughly 1300 people). Also, afterwards, Mike signed his books for attendees and we estimate that 500+
    were in line to get a book signed. I would HIGHLY recommend Mike to anyone who needs a closing guest speaker.”

    You fit in perfectly with our company values. Please consider yourself an honorary member of the Cook family.
    <br/><br/>
    The feedback we got from the work you did at our meeting rated higher than anything we did, and it wasn’t even close.
    The message you delivered – the tone of never giving up, team culture, perseverance and overcoming challenges -
    still resonates this week in conversations I have had with people.”

    was just a perfect fit for the event.
    <br/><br/>
    You invested time and did your homework to understand the audience, understand our company, what we're trying to
    achieve, and you effectively honed in on what you could to assist in that journey. As a result, you connected
    immediately and effectively with our employees; your story of focus, persistence and perseverance, success and
    failure, and especially teamwork, combined with astonishing photos and videos, created a truly unique and
    inspiring experience and motivated our team.”

    of our colleagues after his remarks – even if it did nearly cause him to miss his flight. All told, he was a hit.”
