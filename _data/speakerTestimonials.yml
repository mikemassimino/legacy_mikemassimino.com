    “OMG – he was awesome! Everyone loved him!! He stayed to sign books and I think all 300
    people waited in line to have him do so. We extended lunch by 30 min. so that everyone could
    have a chance to meet him, get their photos with him, and get their books signed. Mike is so
    genuine and so personable. He mingled with everyone before and after his talk. He is truly
    fabulous. We’ll certainly recommend him to other groups within UnitedHealth Group.

    We couldn’t have had a better motivator for our team.”

    ‘delivered’ would be a complete understatement. Thank you for helping to inspire my team to
    be at their best with this amazing advancement for myeloma patients...and for helping Janssen Oncology to
    DREAM BIG and GO FAR.”

- quote: “I had the pleasure of hiring Mike to be our closing guest speaker at our annual user summit in
     January 2019 in Houston. In my role over the years, I have hired countless speakers to close out
     large user events and I will say that Mike is one of the best that I have ever hired. Not only is he
     a down to earth person and easy to talk with, but the message he delivers relates to everyone.
     Normally when you hire an external speaker to close out an event, there is usually a good size
     drop-off of people who are trying to catch a flight out of town. Not in our case. I looked around
     the room when Mike started and it was close to being as crowded as day 1 of the event
     (roughly 1300 people). Also afterwards, Mike signed his books for attendees and we estimate
     that 500+ were in line to get a book signed.
     <br/><br/>
     I would HIGHLY recommend Mike to anyone who needs a closing guest speaker.”

    of the meeting for all in attendance. It is always great for me to see an individual like yourself
    with an incredible resume and unique life experiences who is still incredibly humble and down
    to earth (pardon the pun). You fit in perfectly with our company values.
    Please consider yourself an honorary member of the Cook family.”

    “The feedback we got from the work you did at our meeting rated higher than anything we
    did and it wasn’t even close. The message you delivered – the tone of never giving up, team
    culture, perserverance and overcoming challenges - still resonates this week in conversations
    I have had with people. “I used my 30 seconds, I got over it and we have to move on.”
    <br/><br/>
    I can’t tell you how many times I’ve heard that.”

    “You invested time and did your homework to understand the audience, understand our
    company, what we're trying to achieve, and you effectively honed in on what you could to
    assist in that journey. As a result, you connected immediately and effectively with our
    employees; your story of focus, persistence and perseverance, success and failure, and
    especially team work, combined with astonishing photos and videos, created a truly unique and
    inspiring experience and motivated our team.
    <br/><br/>
    Your energy, passion, humor, and connection with the audience was beyond impressive. Your
    message and stories resonated with our employees, many of whom went out of their way to
    share with us how inspiring they thought you are, and for context, this tremendous feedback
    was from an audience used to hearing from exceptional people with exceptional achievements;
    yet you easily topped our past keynotes.”

- quote: “Mike was great. He did a fantastic job of engaging the audience with his stories and down-to-
    earth style (pardon the pun). He hit the mark on our key messages, but didn’t beat people over
    the head with them. He integrated them seamlessly into his stories. I also appreciated that he
    hung around and chatted with a number of our colleagues after his remarks – even if it did
    nearly cause him to miss his flight. All told, he was a hit.”
