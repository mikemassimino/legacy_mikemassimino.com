<p><u>Non-Personally Identifiable Information We Collect and May Process and Store</u></p>
<p>When you visit or use our Site, in addition to Personal Information described above, we and our third-party service providers may use a variety of technologies that automatically and/or passively also collect, process and store other information. Examples of this type of information include your IP address or other unique device identifier (which device identifier is automatically assigned and is used by our (and our third-party service providers&rsquo;) computers use to identify your device), the type of Internet browser or computer operating system you use, demographic information (your age, gender, income, education, profession, zip code, etc.), the date and time you visited our Site, your device location, your mobile network, the pages and advertisements you accessed, your media consumption on the Site (e.g., video viewing), the name of the website from which you linked to our Site and other data involving your use of our Site (&ldquo;Usage Information&rdquo;). Usage Information may be non-identifying or may be associated with your Personal Information. Aggregate information is not linked to your Personal Information. We also may ask for additional information (e.g., your favorite foods, brands and interests) which you have the option not to provide. We and our advertisers and third-party service providers may use various currently existing technology and methods and/or methods and technology that are subsequently developed to collect, process and store the Usage Information. This policy in no way restricts or limits our collection, processing and use of aggregate information and we may use and share this information with third parties to analyze trends, to gather broad demographic information for aggregate use and for marketing and promotional purposes.</p>
<p>Without limiting anything set out elsewhere in this Policy, we can and will use IP addresses to identify a user when we feel it is necessary to enforce compliance with our Terms of Use or to protect the Site, customers, or other individuals. We also reserve the right to use or disclose non-personally identifiable information in any manner we see fit, including for purposes of improving the Site.</p>
<p>Some of the technologies we currently use to collect information include the following:</p>
<p>Cookies, Web Beacons &amp; Similar Technologies</p>
<p>Cookies: We may use &ldquo;cookies&rdquo; &ndash; small pieces of data or text files that are stored on your computer tied to information about you. This information will help us enhance your experience on the Site (e.g., the option of saving your username and password, if any, for the Site by placing a cookie on your personal computer). Cookies can store non-personally identifiable information, such as your IP address, what websites, pages, or advertisements your browser has accessed and may be tied to the Personal Information you knowingly choose to provide to us.</p>
<p>Cookies help establish a user session and allow our server to correctly provide site users with the appropriate information, advertisements and services. We use both persistent and session cookies, as well as embedded scripts. Session cookies and embedded scripts exist only for as long as your browser remains open. When the session ends, the browser is closed and the cookies and embedded scripts are deleted or deactivated. Persistent cookies, in contrast, last from visit to visit. Persistent cookies are saved on a visitor&rsquo;s computer by the browser and do not go away when you exit your browser. We may use both types of cookies to enable us to collect aggregate information on the usage patterns of our Site, such as what areas of the Site are visited most often, so we can tailor our Site to user preferences. Some of our advertisers and sponsors occasionally serve you cookies as well. We do not have control over cookies placed by advertisers or sponsors. We may also use advertising service vendors to help display or present advertisements on the Site and/or provide analytic information regarding such advertisements. These vendors may use cookies, web beacons, or similar technologies to serve you advertisements tailored to interests you have shown by browsing on this and other websites you have visited, to determine whether you have seen a particular advertisement before and to avoid sending you duplicate advertisements. In doing so, you may voluntarily furnish Personal Information to such vendor and/or these vendors may also collect Usage Information (see above for more information). Even if they use our technology to track, collect or store data, the use of cookies, web beacons, or other tracking technologies by these advertisers, sponsors and advertising service vendors is subject to their own privacy policies, not ours, and Service Provider disclaims all liability in connection therewith. If you do not want the benefits of these advertising cookies, you may be able to opt-out in the United States by visiting http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp; note that &ldquo;opting-out&rdquo; through these procedures does not mean that you will not receive targeted content and/or ads from third parties that are sent by companies that are not the National Advertising Initiative members with respect to which you opted-out. If you are located in the US, you may also opt-out of received third party behavioral ads on the Site by opting-out on the Digital Advertising Alliance website at www.aboutads.info/choices.</p>
<p>A &ldquo;Flash&rdquo; cookie is placed on your device via the Adobe Flash plug-in that may be built into or downloaded to you to your device; information regarding disabling Flash cookies can be found on Adobe&rsquo;s website at www.adobe.com. &ldquo;HTML5&rdquo; cookies do not require a plug-in.</p>
<p>Most Internet browsers can be set to refuse to accept cookies, although this may affect your Internet experience. You can also erase cookies that are already on your computer, block all cookies or receive a warning before a cookie is stored. Each browser you use will need to be set separately, and each browser offers different functionality and options, and browser settings may not effectively block or disable Flash cookies or HTML5 cookies.

We use web beacons to help manage the effectiveness of our online advertising and to gather access information, such as counting the users who have visited those pages, compiling aggregated statistics about Site usage and monitoring how users navigate the Site.</p>

In general, if the business has made such a disclosure of personal information, the business is required to provide a list of all third parties to whom such personal information was disclosed in the preceding calendar year, as well as a list of the categories of personal information that were disclosed, upon receipt of a request by a California resident. However, under the law, a business is not required to provide the above-described lists if the business adopts and discloses to the public (in its privacy policy) a policy of not disclosing personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes unless the customer first affirmatively agrees to the disclosure, as long as the business maintains and discloses this policy. Rather, the business may comply with the law by notifying the customer of his or her right to prevent disclosure of personal information and providing a cost free means to exercise that right. As described in this Policy, Service Provider does not disclose such personal information of a California resident to any third party for its direct marketing purposes without consent.</p>
