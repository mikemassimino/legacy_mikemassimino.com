        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>Mike shares with audiences personal stories of inspiration, innovation,
            teamwork and leadership as drawn from his experiences in one of the
            greatest and most dangerous jobs someone can have—NASA astronaut.
            Through humor and storytelling, he highlights the pursuit and achievement
            of a childhood dream, the dedication and teamwork necessary to train for
            one of NASA’s most difficult space missions, the determination needed
            to face tragedies like the Columbia space shuttle accident, and
            the innovation and leadership necessary to overcome seemingly
            insurmountable trials when in space and beyond. He leaves his
            audiences understanding the value of having passion for what you do,
            of perseverance in achieving a goal, of building a team to meet great
            challenges, and of creativity and innovation in problem solving. He
            also inspires audiences with the awe and beauty of space and shares
            his thoughts on the future—both personal and in regard to the ever-changing
            and competitive space program.</p>
